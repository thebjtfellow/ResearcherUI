# ResearcherUI
This is the official source code for the UI of the B-Jetting Researcher BJT Machine. Qt Creator Required 6.3+, RPi 64-bit OS

Pursuant to the terms for using an open license of Qt Creator and the Qt framework, this is the source code for the commercial binder jetting machine marketed as "The Educator" and "The Researcher"

It's a very basic STL slicer that supports the functiosn required for binder jetting. 

You have to manually put the shader files in the directory that you from the UI from. I usually execute out of the debugger directly

You can view the machine at https://www.b-jetting.com
